Plan:

- find the frequency of the strongest signal
- try to find the corresponding musical pitch
- if we do chords:
  - detect multiple pitches
  - translate all of those
  - figure out what kind of chord that is

Issues:

Done:

- Pressing % after typing more than a number gives NaN (5/5%)
- Parentheses do not work
- Multiplication sign is weird
- Maybe typing after pressing = could clear the display
- Code could be simpler
